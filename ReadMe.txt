# Plan:
    1. training (documenting EVERYTHING!!!)
        1.1 how to create a Web Archive in the WARC-file format (soon many german newspapers will close their content due to contracts with AI-corporations)
        1.2 how to webscrape each HTML-Webpages
        1.3 which data and metadate will be preserved? How to make it worthwhile, so the most data is saved in the best standardized way (What specific cases are to be focused on?)
        1.4 what exactly do i want to do with the corpus? Like what types of (historical, not linguistic) research can be done on the basis of the data (prpbly pandas?)
        1.5 (exactly looking up the copyright. Maybe even ask a lawyer?)
    
    2. doing the paperwork (looking for second corrector, Thesis-Application)
    
    3. a big pause to write the last Hausarbeit
    
    4. actually writing that damn thing
